## Do you Know?
Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases. 
Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated gases, etc. are some of the green house gases. These gases causes the climate change, increases the surface temperatures and leads to global warming.
These gases are released into atmosphere through various human activities.
Carbon dioxide is the primary green house gas emitted and accounted for 79% of all green house gases. It is about it enters into the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels (like coal, natural gas and oil), trees, solid wastes and other biological materials.
Steep increase in overall CO2 emissions raised during the 20th century, raised concerns about climate change.
Deforestation accounts for about 20% of the CO2 increase from human activities.
Our personal vehicles are the major cause of carbon emission.
There are over 600 million motor vehicles in the world today.
Burning one gallon of gasoline generates 22 pounds of Carbon Dioxide. When gasoline is burned, the carbon in it is combined with the atmospheric oxygen to form Carbon dioxide.
If present trend continues, the number of cars on Earth will be doubled in next 30 years.
This increases the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, which results in increase of surface temperatures of the Earth, which in turn leads to melting of polar ice caps, which effects the habitat of polar animals.
Melting of ice caps increases the mean sea level, which can lead to submerging of many coastal areas in the world.
So, we can say that emission of CO2 into the atmosphere causes environmental imbalance and it can be treated as global hazard.
Can we reduce the carbon emission from vehicles?
Yes, we can find a way to reduce the carbon emission from vehicles into the atmosphere by minimizing the use of personal vehicles and preferring public transport.
The increase in carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere, increase the surface temperature which cause polar caps to melt and making it hard for polar animals to survive.
We collected the data from an open source website regarding the four wheeler vehicles which are in use in Canada.
