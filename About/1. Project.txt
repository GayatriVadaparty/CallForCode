Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases. 
Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated gases, etc. are some of the green house gases. These gases causes the climate change, increases the surface temperatures and leads to global warming.
These gases are released into atmosphere through various human activities.
Carbon dioxide is the primary green house gas emitted and accounted for 79% of all green house gases. It is about it enters into the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels (like coal, natural gas and oil), trees, solid wastes and other biological materials.
Steep increase in overall CO2 emissions raised during the 20th century, raised concerns about climate change.
Deforestation accounts for about 20% of the CO2 increase from human activities.
