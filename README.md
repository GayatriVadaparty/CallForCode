 The theme for this Challenge Accelerator is Protecting our Environment. Global biodiversity is an essential component of sustainability as it can support critical needs from food security and nutrition to the regulation of water and air quality, as well as pest and disease regulation. As the largest driver of climate change, carbon emissions negatively impact not only the environment and biodiversity, but also global economies, human health, weather, sea levels, food supplies, and quality of life. Organizations must understand their carbon emissions and use that knowledge to inform their actions to reduce them. Learn how thoughtful, scalable technology solutions are needed to help the world move swiftly towards net zero carbon emissions and protect our environment.
